%TOC%

This is the supplemental plugin for the !BlogApp <nop>WikiApplication.
It bundles some of the features found in common blogging applications 
that are very hard or even impossible to implement using <nop>TML (Topic Markup Language). 

---++ Syntax Rules

---+++ PREVDOC, NEXTDOC
Display the previous/next topic in an ordered set.
These tags can be used to establish a navigation within a set of related topics
paging to the preceding or succeeding one. A set of related topics is defined
using a "where" and an "order" clause which the given topic is supposed to be part of.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>PREVDOC{"&lt;topic" where="..." ...}%, %<nop>NEXTDOC{"&lt;topic" where="..." ...}%* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= | topic which we search the predecessor/successor of |
| =web="..."= | web where to search for related topics; \
  defaults to the web given with the &lt;topic> parameter or the current one |
| =where="..."= \
| search clause, see documentation of the DBCacheContrib |
| =order="..."= \
| document property used to sort the hit set; defaults to "created" |
| =reverse="on,off"= \
| if set to on the sorting will be reversed, that is the logic of PREV and NEXT is inverted |
